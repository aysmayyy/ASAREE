"""A protocol run -- one execution of a Protocol's graph.

Mirrors Motoro's AgentRun/RunStatus pattern (the only lifecycle/
state-machine precedent in this codebase) rather than inventing a new one:
a plain string status ("pending"/"running"/"finalizing"/"completed"/"failed" -- not a DB
enum, same reasoning as ResearchExperiment.design_type) plus a heartbeat
column for the same staleness-detection convention AgentRun uses.
