"""asaree-workspace — ASAREE's own workspace-orchestration MCP server.

Opens/seeds a per-cell workspace from the dataset registry and drives the staged,
leakage-safe handoff (status, accept, structural gate, manifest). Thin wrapper
over :mod:`asaree_workspace_core`. Bundled and auto-registered by ASAREE itself
as a global system server (``asaree.app``'s lifespan) — not something a
researcher registers, and not one copy per owner.

``open_workspace`` is the only tool that touches the dataset registry, and it
does so as a direct, in-process call to ``asaree.services.datasets`` (this is
ASAREE's own code, running in ASAREE's own process family — no HTTP round-trip,
no service token to manage), scoped to the run's owner via the ambient
``_meta`` (``resolve_owner_id_from_ctx``) rather than trusting a bare dataset
name. Every other tool operates purely on the shared on-disk workspace.
Directly invocable — the notebook driver runs in a different process from the
agents and drives resume from here.

# Which stages exist, and how each one hands off, is the workspace's own stage
# plan (asaree_workspace_core.stages) — not a constant here. It defaults to the
# `tabular_ml` preset, which is the dc/fte/fs pipeline these tools used to
# hardcode, so an unconfigured experiment behaves exactly as before.
#
# Two per-stage flags on that plan drive the handoff:
#
# `scratch` — the stage hands off through a disposable scratch directory. A
# domain server for a scratch stage never imports asaree_workspace_core; it only
# reads/writes plain train.parquet/test.parquet/meta.json/learned.json in that
# directory (see _scratch_dir below), and this server is the only thing that
# ever touches the permanent versioned tree.
#
# `fixed_input` — which of two conventions the stage's tools share inside that
# one directory:
#   - chain (dc, fte): each tool reads whatever's currently in
#     train.parquet/test.parquet and overwrites it — the working copy evolves
#     tool call by tool call within one attempt.
#   - fixed-input (fs): every tool independently re-reads the UNCHANGING
#     input_train.parquet/input_test.parquet (seeded once, never touched again
#     this attempt) and writes its candidate selection to
#     train.parquet/test.parquet — nothing chains via the working copy, so the
#     fixed pair lets a stage's tools be fully independent of each other's call
#     order, exactly like the old resolve_stage_input flow.
# Both files are always seeded (see _seed_scratch); a chain stage's tools simply
# never read the fixed pair, and a fixed-input stage's tools never read/write
# the working pair until they're ready to produce their result.

    held-out test rows are never surfaced (leakage guard).

    In a run started by ASAREE with a Dataset wired, you normally do not need to
    call this at all — ASAREE seeds the cell's workspace before your first turn
    (``services.dataset_workspaces.seed_cell_workspace``) and your prompt says so.
    It remains the entry point for everything that isn't that case: calling from
    outside a run, overriding the target column, picking between several wired
    datasets, (re)seeding a stage's scratch area, or re-reading the summary below.

    Every argument is optional in a run started by ASAREE: the workspace and the
    wired dataset both arrive as ambient request ``_meta``, so the usual call is
    a bare ``open_workspace()``. Pass an argument only to override what the run
    already knows, or when calling from outside a run.

    Args:
        experiment_id: The experiment this cell belongs to (workspace namespace).
            Optional — with cell_label, resolved from the ambient workspace_id.
        cell_label: Safe per-cell label. Optional, as above.
        name: Registered dataset name (must be a pre-split train/test registration,
            and owned by the user who started this run). Optional — resolved from
            _meta when the run has exactly one dataset wired; with several, this
            picks between them and the error lists the candidates. Inside an
            ASAREE run an explicit name must be one of those wired candidates;
            outside a run any owned registration may be named.
        target_column: Override target column; defaults to the registry's.
        stage: For a stage that hands off through a scratch directory (the
            default for every stage — see the stage-plan flags at the top of this
            module), (re)materializes that stage's current working matrix into
            its scratch directory, so the calling domain server's tools have a
            clean starting point. Omit for stages still on the old
            shared-library flow. The response's ``stages`` lists this
            workspace's stage ids, which are ``dc``/``fte``/``fs`` unless the
            experiment declared its own pipeline.
        slot: Which slot of the cell's workspace to open this dataset into.
            Optional and rarely needed — it defaults to a slot named for the
            dataset, so opening two datasets into one cell gives each its own
            lineage, target column and HEAD without you naming anything. The
            response echoes the slot to pass to later staging calls.

    block — the provenance a domain server has written to its scratch dir so
    far this attempt, before accept_stage ever promotes it (or reset_stage
    discards it).

    Unlike read_stage_manifest (which only ever has something once a stage is
    ACCEPTED), this is the only place a rejected-but-not-yet-accepted attempt's
    decisions exist — needed to snapshot them before a critic-requested
    revision resets the scratch dir out from under them.

    Args:
        stage: a stage id from this workspace's stage plan — ``dc``, ``fte`` or
            ``fs`` unless the experiment declared its own pipeline, in which
            case ``workspace_status()`` reports the ids.
        workspace_id: optional; resolved from _meta when omitted.
        slot: Which dataset slot of this cell's workspace the call is about.
            Optional — omit it when the cell holds one dataset (the usual case)
            and it resolves to that one. With several open, omitting it is an
            error listing them, because picking one would be a guess; the slot
            keys are in your prompt and in workspace_status().
