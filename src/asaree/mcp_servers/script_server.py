"""asaree-script — executes the Script node wired into an agent, as plain Python.

The gap this fills: a Script node is a REFERENCE (its code is written to disk
and published as ambient ``_meta`` — see ``protocol_execution._ambient_meta_for``),
and ASAREE itself never executes one. Until this server existed, the only things
that could were ``asaree-sklearn-model``'s ``run_model_script`` and
``scikit-learn-mcp``'s ``run_script`` — both model-fitting harnesses that
require a dataset and a ``predict_proba``/``predict`` callable. So a Script node
wired without one of those servers was inert: the agent was told a script was
waiting and had no tool that could run it.

One tool, ``run_wired_script``, with no code-shaped argument in the normal case:
the scripts arrive ambiently, so what runs is byte-for-byte what the user wrote
on the canvas. With one script it remains argument-free; with several, the
caller selects one by its configured name or node id. It is ordinary Python —
no contract about what the script must define, no dataset required — which is
what makes it the executor for the scripts the sklearn harnesses reject.

Bundled and auto-registered as a global system server
(``services/system_mcp_servers.py``), and granted implicitly to any agent with a
Script node wired (``protocol_execution._resolve_script_tool_config``) — the same
arrangement as the Dataset connector and the workspace tools, so wiring a script
is the only gesture needed to let the agent run it.

When a Dataset is also wired, the subprocess receives a short-lived runtime
manifest through :mod:`asaree.script_context`. That stable API resolves either
an unsplit raw file or a workspace's ``v0_raw`` training partition without
exposing the held-out test partition or making user code parse ``state.json``.
Legacy scripts that explicitly read ``state.json`` receive the same training
reference through an isolated, execution-only compatibility view; it is never
written at the real workspace root.

**This is isolation, not a sandbox.** The script runs as a subprocess of this
server, with a deny-by-default environment (see ``_ENV_PASSTHROUGH``) and a
timeout, but it runs as the same user with the same filesystem. That is the trust
level ASAREE already operates at — the sklearn servers ``exec`` user-supplied
code in-process — and a subprocess is strictly better than that, not a security
boundary. Anything stronger (a container, a seccomp profile, a resource limit)
belongs here as a future change, and is why every spawn goes through one function.
