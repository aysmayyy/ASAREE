"""Design generation — the "design experiments" half of ASAREE's vision
(project_plan/core_asaree_use_case.md §10), the part safe to build as a
genuine platform primitive: pure combinatorics over arbitrary factors, no
use-case-specific assumptions. The other half (orchestration — the
critic-gating loop, workspace staging) stays notebook-side, deliberately.

Two responsibilities, kept separate: computing the design (pure, no I/O) and
materializing it as ``FactorialCell`` parents with
``FactorialReplicateResult`` children under a *design revision*
(see services.design_revisions). Generation used to be purely additive, which
meant a design that shrank left the old design's cells behind to pollute every
count and every "run all cells"; a design whose cell set changes now opens a
new revision and carries forward the results of any combination the two share.

    the current revision has — not on every change. Re-clicking generate,
    changing ``randomization_seed``, widening a factor's levels or raising
    ``replicates`` all leave every existing cell part of the new design, so
    they keep the current revision and merge into its rows: no near-empty
    duplicate revisions pile up, and (as before) the cells you already scored
    are untouched, right down to their row ids.

    Once a publication references the design, its declaration and planned
    slots are frozen. Any subsequent change creates a separate draft design;
    results remain with the experiment version that produced them. Clicking
    Generate again with the same declaration reuses the existing design.

    Dropping a cell is the case that needs a revision (see
    services.design_revisions). This is the fix for cells outliving the design
    that created them: shrinking a design from 6 cells to 2 used to leave all 6
    in place — still counted in "0/6 scored", still picked up by "run all
    cells" — because generation was purely additive and nothing ever removed a
    combination. The old cells now stay under their own superseded revision,
    where they remain readable as history but are invisible to every
    current-design reader. Results for a label the two revisions share are
    carried forward into the new one, so shrinking a design only costs you the
    combinations you actually removed.

    ``randomization_seed``, when set, only shuffles the *order* of the
    returned list (assignment-order independence, standard factorial-design
    practice) — it never affects which combinations/replicates are generated
