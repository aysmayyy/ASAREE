"""Delivery of one agent's question to a connected peer, and the run that hosts it.

Motoro's :class:`~motoro.engine.ports.AgentMessengerPort` is deliberately one
method wide: the engine projects the peers a caller declared into callable
function schemas and hands any resulting call straight back here. Everything
that decides *whether* the call happens lives in this module -- authorization,
message identity and ordering, the transcript, recursion safety, and cancellation.
The engine never learns what an ASAREE canvas is.

**The reply is a call result, not an exception.** A peer that may not be
reached, a recursion-depth refusal and a cancelled conversation all come back as an
:class:`~motoro.engine.ports.AgentReply` with a state the calling model can
read, so it absorbs the outcome and still writes a real answer. Only genuine
infrastructure failure raises.

**Every turn reads the whole conversation.** A consulted peer is given the
transcript so far (:meth:`AgentMessenger._briefing`) ahead of the question, so it
recalls its own earlier turns and can build on what other agents have already
found. That is one mechanism serving both, because both are the same question --
what does this turn get to read. The entry agent needs no briefing: it is a
single continuous run, so its own scratchpad already holds every reply it got.

**Capability is snapshotted; reachability is live.** A peer's card describes it
as the published revision configures it, so a canvas edit cannot hot-patch a
run's agents mid-flight. Authorization is re-asked of the *draft* graph on every
single consultation, so pulling the edge on the canvas stops the next
consultation immediately. Two different questions, deliberately reading two
different graphs.

This module imports the executor, never the reverse. A pipeline run knows
nothing about conversations, which is what keeps invariant 11 (single-agent runs
are byte-for-byte unaffected) structural rather than a promise.

    function schema the model chooses to call, so a supervisor that decides two
    of its three workers suffice produces a run that isn't comparable to one
    that used all three. An experiment measures a fixed treatment; ASAREE
    dispatches every worker itself, which is what makes "all three ran" a

    HEAD out from under each other. Serial mode exists for the case where that
    isolation is not what the user wants (workers deliberately building on each

    A sequential handoff *is* one agent sending its work to another, so it
    belongs in the same transcript a peer conversation gets -- the user was
    reading a chain run's handoffs out of five separate node-output panels and
    reconstructing the order by hand. Writing it here costs one row update and
    the transcript panel (``ConversationTranscript.tsx``) already renders any
    ``Conversation``, so the UI is free.

    Deliberately the **message layer only**, not :func:`execute_conversation`:
    the chain is executed by ``run_protocol``'s topological walk, which is the
    entire point of the sequential strategy (every node runs, in order, with no
    agent deciding whether to hand off). Routing it through the conversation
    executor would hand that decision back to the models. Nothing here can
    influence execution -- no budget is charged, no peer is run, no
    authorization is asked.

    Written once, after the walk, rather than appended between nodes: the
    canvas already shows per-node progress live, so an incremental transcript
    would buy nothing and would put a second write inside the two different
    branches (plain node, gated pair) that complete an agent's turn.

    *chain* is ``sequential_chain_order``'s output, so a non-agent node between
    two agents (a Critic Gate, a Script) is already collapsed away -- the
    transcript shows the handoff the user drew, not the plumbing it passed
    through. *entry_prompt* is the head agent's own built ``user_input``, which
    stands in as what the user asked.
