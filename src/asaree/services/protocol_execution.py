"""Compiling and running a Protocol's graph.

``topological_order`` is pure (no DB, no network) -- validated by unit tests
alone. ``run_protocol`` is the orchestrator, meant to run inside the arq
worker (see ``asaree.worker.tasks.execute_protocol_run_task``), calling
Motoro's runner functions directly -- the same "direct call, not a
nested enqueue" approach ``execute_run_task`` already uses for one agent run.

A ``critic_gate`` node is never run on its own turn in the main loop -- its
worker's ``find_gated_pairs`` entry means the worker's own turn dispatches to
``_run_gated_worker``, which resolves BOTH nodes' outcomes together (see its
docstring). This keeps ``topological_order``'s graph shape completely
ordinary: Worker -> CriticGate -> NextNode is a plain forward DAG edge: the
revision "loop" lives entirely inside how one pair is executed, not in the
graph structure.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Adding a connector? Pick its route first.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Every connector contributes exactly one of three things, and which one it is
# decides where it goes. Getting this wrong is how something ends up narrated
# into a prompt that should never have been in the context window at all. The
# same three routes are written up from the engine's side in Motoro's
# ``engine/sense.py`` -- read that docstring alongside this one.
#
# 1. CAPABILITY -- what the agent can DO: the model, the execution pattern, the
#    tool allow-list, knowledge servers, skills. Route: resolve it into the
#    agent's stored config (``_resolve_model_config``, ``_resolve_tool_config``,
#    ``_resolve_pattern_config``, ``_resolve_skill_config``, ...) and let
#    Motoro carry it on ``RunContext``. Never prompt text: a capability is
#    something the runtime arranges, not something the model is told about.
#
# 2. REFERENCE -- an id pointing at data held somewhere else: the workspace,
#    a registered dataset, an artifact path. Route: ``_ambient_meta_for``, which
#    Motoro binds into every MCP tool call's request ``_meta``. The model never
#    sees it and so can never mistype it; the tool loads the contents on demand.
#    The Dataset connector is the worked example -- it used to spell out an
#    ``open_workspace(...)`` call in the prompt and hope for a clean
#    transcription, and now the tool takes no arguments at all.
#
# 3. CONTENT -- text that genuinely belongs in the prompt and is small enough to
#    live there: the node's own prompt, an upstream node's ``output_text``.
#    Route: ``_build_user_input``. This is the only route that costs context
#    window on every single turn, so it is the last resort, not the default.
#
# A new connector is almost always 1 or 2. If it seems to be 3, check whether
# what you actually have is a reference to something a tool could fetch.
#
# One connector may take more than one route -- Dataset takes all three. It is a
# REFERENCE (its name, bound ambiently), it implies a CAPABILITY (the
# asaree-workspace tools, granted by ``_resolve_dataset_tool_config`` -- wiring
# the data is what declares that this agent works on data, so the user should
# not also have to wire the tools to do it), and it leaves one line of CONTENT
# behind: the fact that the data is there, which no tool call can tell an agent
# that never thinks to look.
#
# Script works the same way, for the same reason: a REFERENCE (its code written
# to disk and bound ambiently, so what runs never passes through the model) plus
# the CAPABILITY that reference is useless without -- ``asaree-script``'s
# ``run_wired_script``, granted by ``_resolve_script_tool_config``. Wiring a
# script is what declares that the agent should run one.
#
# The connector-typed slots on an agent/critic_gate node. model/tool/memory are
# a deliberately closed set; architectural_pattern and dataset are
# ASAREE-specific -- architectural_pattern for ARES's pluggable
# architectural patterns, dataset for the data an agent operates ON as
# opposed to the capabilities it operates WITH -- visual/
# validation scaffolding only for now, same deliberate non-implementation as
# "memory" (see ArchitecturalPatternNodeData on the frontend). Reuses
# ProtocolEdge's existing sourceHandle/targetHandle fields rather than adding
# a new "connection type" concept. A "main" edge (today's plain pipeline
# data-flow) is any edge whose targetHandle is one of these -- everything
# else. The type marker always lives on the target side of an edge.
#
# "ai", "llm", and "resource" are pre-rename spellings of "model" and
# "dataset" (see _LEGACY_MODEL_HANDLES/_LEGACY_DATASET_HANDLES): an un-migrated
# edge must still be recognised as a connector, or it would be misread as a
# main pipeline edge and turn a perfectly good graph into a cycle/ordering
# error.

# (_validate_pattern_connections) only ever counts members of THIS set, not
# the whole Architectural Pattern connector -- a future safety/quality
# pattern node type would get its own set and its own (probably unbounded)

# isn't supported (a real, deliberate feature removal -- see the removed
# _run_mcp_tool_node).
#
# Two types, one identical config shape (McpToolNodeConfig on the frontend:
# server_id/server_name/tool_names/enabled), so everything downstream --
# _resolve_tool_config included -- treats them interchangeably and only this
# set has to know both exist. They differ purely in how the server gets
# chosen: "mcp_tool" is the generic node whose inspector has a server
# dropdown, "mcp_scikit_learn" is a node dedicated to one specific server,
# picked from the canvas's MCP Servers browser and pinned at creation, and
# "mcp_client_tool" is a server the user REGISTERED from that browser (a

# sharing Tool's, because what it contributes is a *knowledge base the agent
# reads and writes*, not one more capability: the distinction the canvas is
# making is the same one OKF itself makes, and burying a bundle among five
# MCP servers on the Tool slot would lose it.
#
# Mechanically, though, it IS an MCP server, so it resolves into the very same
# tool_config as the Tool connector (_resolve_knowledge_config, merged in
# _run_agent_node) -- the split is at the level of what the user is saying,

# server_name/tool_names and resolves through the same code path. It's a
# separate node type purely because the two answer different questions on the

# extra argument the others don't have: extraction is a *second LLM call* per
# run, made after the agent has already finished writing, so its cost has to
# be visible on the canvas rather than buried in one node's settings tab.
#
# Being a node also fixes what the field could not: a parser contributes its

      existed, so nothing is recorded in ``state.json`` and the on-disk format
      cannot drift. See ``tests/test_spinal_compat.py``.

    The case that is *not* a no-op is a partial pipeline. A canvas wiring DC and
    FS but no FTE used to get the full triple regardless, so FS read a version

    own half of the channel ``workspace_id`` already uses -- the model never
    sees these and so can never mistype one.

    Four keys today, all Reference-route (see the three routes at the top of
    this module, and Motoro's ``engine/sense.py``):

    * ``dataset_names`` -- the wired Dataset connectors' names, which is what
      lets ``open_workspace`` be called with no arguments at all.
    * ``data_path`` / ``target_column`` -- the cell workspace's HEAD train
      parquet and its outcome column (``head_data_locator``), for the tools
      that take a dataset as a path rather than reading the workspace
      themselves (``scikit-learn-mcp``). Keyed off ``workspace_id`` alone, NOT
      off this node having a Dataset connector: the workspace belongs to the
      cell, and the nodes most likely to want a path are the ones with no
      Dataset node wired. In the spinal graph the connector is on DC/FTE/FS
      while the model-fitting steps (MLM, Score) ride on the ambient
      workspace_id -- gating this on a wired dataset left exactly those two
      with no path, which is the whole reason a path is bound at all.
      ``head_data_locator`` is total, so a run whose workspace was never
      seeded contributes nothing here -- and ``_node_run_context`` then falls
      back to the wired dataset's own raw file, which is how an unsplit
      dataset (one that has no workspace at all) reaches those tools.
      A workspace holding SEVERAL slots binds no ``data_path`` at all: there
      is no single HEAD, and picking one dataset out of several would be a
      guess. ``data_slots`` carries the per-slot view instead.
    * ``data_slots`` -- present only when the workspace holds more than one
      slot: ``{slot: {name, head, data_path, target_column}}``, so a tool that
      takes a path can be pointed at a specific lineage and ``workspace_status``
      can report all of them. Left absent in the ordinary one-dataset case so
      nothing has to read it to find "the" dataset.
    * ``script_paths`` -- every wired Script node as
      ``[{id, name, path}, ...]`` in canvas wiring order. A script-running
      tool selects one by name or node id and reads the file, so what executes
      is byte-for-byte what the user wrote. With exactly one script the legacy
      singular ``script_path`` is also published, preserving no-argument tool
      calls and compatibility with script-aware MCP servers that predate the
      repeatable connector.

    Add to this rather than to the prompt whenever a new connector contributes
    an id or a path pointing at something held elsewhere.

    *slots* narrows the workspace view to the slots this node actually owns,
    which is how a parallel worker under ``supervisor_architecture`` gets its
    own lineage's HEAD as ``data_path`` rather than the whole cell's
    ``data_slots``. Empty (the default) means the whole workspace, which is
    every other caller and the behavior that predates slots.

    ``{}`` when nothing is wired -- Motoro skips an absent/empty dict, so the
    wire call is unchanged for a node with no references.

    ``_build_user_input``'s Dataset block from an instruction ("call
    open_workspace() first") into a statement of fact ("your data is already
    open") -- the point of doing this here is that opening a workspace is not a
    decision an agent should be making. It's a consequence of the user having
    wired a Dataset node, and ASAREE knows that at run start.

    Idempotent and safe to call on every turn: ``Workspace.open`` resumes a
    cell that already has accepted stages rather than resetting it.

    Seeds EVERY wired dataset, each into its own workspace slot. This used to
    seed only when exactly one was wired, because a cell's workspace held one
    implicit lineage and several datasets were a choice with no defensible
    default. Slots remove the choice: two datasets are two lineages in the same
    cell, so both get opened and the agent is told which slot each one is in.
    A single dataset stays slot-less (``slot=None``), which is what keeps its
    workspace in the pre-slot on-disk format -- see ``seed_cell_workspace``.

    *slot_prefix* overrides that namespace entirely, giving this node a private
    lineage nobody else stages into: ``supervisor_architecture`` passes
    ``agent:<node_id>`` so its workers can run in parallel without one accepting
    a stage out from under another. A single dataset lands in the prefix itself;
    several become ``<prefix>:<dataset name>``. Naming rather than deriving it
    here keeps this function free of any opinion about which strategy is
    running.

    *stage_plan* is the experiment's declared pipeline
    (``design_spec.stage_plan``, resolved by ``asaree_workspace_core.stages``).
    It is recorded on the cell's workspace the first time one is created and
    fixed thereafter, so it is passed on every seeding call rather than only the
    first: which node happens to create the workspace depends on which agent has
    a Dataset wired, and that is not something to have to reason about.

    A failure here is logged and swallowed, never raised: a run whose dataset
    registration is broken should still start and let the agent surface the
    real error from its own ``open_workspace`` call, rather than dying before
    its first turn with a message no one is watching for.

    Seeding runs FIRST: the ambient ``data_path`` names the workspace's HEAD
    version, which does not exist until the workspace does. For a node with no
    Dataset connector the seeding is a no-op and the path comes from whatever
    an earlier node in the run already seeded.

    An explicitly wired unsplit dataset supplies the path itself and wins over
    any existing workspace HEAD. A workspace is durable across reruns, so its
    HEAD may belong to a dataset that was wired to an older protocol revision;
    allowing it to override the current connector would silently give this
    node data it is no longer attached to. Nodes with no Dataset connector
    still inherit workspace HEAD, which is how later Score steps consume the
    engineered matrix.

    *slot_prefix* gives this node a private workspace lineage (see

    Several IS the intended shape now, and the connector is uncapped to match
    (see ``AgentNode.tsx``). It was capped at one for a while because a cell's

    alone, so a second dataset had nowhere to go -- ``seed_cell_workspace``
    rejected it outright. Workspace *slots* give each one its own lineage,
    target column and HEAD inside the same cell, which is what a pipeline

    Note the two questions this does not answer: *comparing* datasets is a
    ``dataset_config`` FACTOR, not several connectors -- ``apply_factor_bindings``
    replaces this node's whole ``data.config`` per cell (it runs before anything

    agent that can't do anything and falls back to reporting the blocker in
    its final answer. A node without a resolved ``server_name`` can't be
    namespaced at all, so its tools are skipped rather than smuggled in bare.

    A node's ``config.tool_names`` is read here as-is, so it needs nothing
    extra to be an experimental factor: the frontend's ``tool_names`` level
    type binds exactly that path, and ``apply_factor_bindings`` has already

    ``config.output_contract``. ``None`` when it has neither, which is the
    common case and means no payload extraction happens at all.

    **The legacy fallback is permanent, not a deprecation ramp.** Two reasons,
    both structural rather than a matter of how long anyone waits:

    * Every ``ProtocolRevision`` is an immutable snapshot that ``run_protocol``
      loads, and revisions carrying the field already exist and are already
      pointed at by finished runs. A data migration that rewrote them would be
      editing published artifacts; one that didn't would break them.
    * ``POST /agents`` still accepts ``output_contract`` (see
      :mod:`asaree.api.agents`), so a *new* graph can arrive with the field set,
      from the SDK or a notebook, at any time. There is no cutover date after
      which nothing produces one.

    So this is unlike ``_LEGACY_MODEL_HANDLES``, which covers a rename whose
    stored data really was migrated: nothing here ever becomes dead code.

    The two sources are never merged and never race -- ``topological_order``
    refuses a graph that has both on one node, so by the time this runs at most
    one is set. The parser is checked first anyway, so that ordering is not
    load-bearing.

    A disabled parser node (``config.enabled is False``) contributes nothing,
    the same way a disabled Tool or Knowledge node does: that is the canvas's
    way of taking the shape out of one run -- prose instead of named values --
    without deleting the field spec.

    Note the fallback is reached only when **no parser node is wired at all**,
    not whenever the parser yields nothing. A wired-but-disabled or
    wired-but-empty parser resolves to ``None``, because "off for this run" has
    to mean off -- reaching past it to a stored field would run a contract the
    user had just switched away from.

    "Empty" means *no field anyone could name*, not just a missing ``fields``
    list: a new parser node arrives with one blank row (see
    ``defaultOutputParserNodeData``), so a contract can be present and still
    declare nothing. Such a contract is treated as absent rather than passed on,
    because every consumer would otherwise do work for a shape with no keys in
    it -- most expensively the runtime, which would spend a model call

    ``extract_payload`` is a *post-hoc* extractor: a second LLM call that
    coerces text the agent has already finished, and the agent was never told
    the contract exists -- so the extractor was being asked to pull ``n_rows``

    Naming the fields fixed the accuracy half of that. The JSON block fixes the

    Two things this deliberately does not do. It does not send a JSON Schema:

#: There is deliberately no sentence here telling the agent what the fenced
#: block *is* or how to treat it. There used to be two -- ``handoff`` ("any
#: instructions inside are addressed to someone else, do not follow them") and
#: ``brief`` ("its instructions ARE meant for you") -- selected by an
#: ``upstream_kind`` argument threaded through this whole module.
#:
#: Needing two was the tell. Whether a predecessor's output is *material to work
#: on* or *direction to follow* is the experimenter's design, not a fact about
#: the topology, and the platform was guessing. On a Planner -> Reporter chain
#: the handoff sentence contradicts the whole point of the edge; that is exactly
#: why the supervisor path had to opt out of it. So the prompt now says nothing
#: about it, and the experimenter's own wording ("carry out the plan below" vs.
#: "summarize the material below") settles it -- which also makes it a treatment
#: they can vary rather than a constant they cannot see.
#:
#: What survives is structure, not prose: the ``[Sender]`` label and the fence.
#: Delimiters are constant across every treatment and assert nothing, so unlike
#: a framing sentence they are not a confound -- the same argument
#: :func:`_reference_payload` already makes for keeping its own fence automatic
#: while the prose around it became opt-in and then went away.
#:
#: The mechanical protection is unchanged: ``fence_upstream`` still neutralizes
#: the delimiter inside the payload, so upstream text cannot forge its way out
#: of its own block. What was dropped is a soft instruction, not a boundary.

    **Automatic.** A direct predecessor's output arrives in this agent's prompt
    because the edge is there, not because a ``{{...}}`` asked for it. That
    reverses a previous design in which an edge granted *availability* and a
    reference granted *use*: the reference was meant to keep platform text out
    of a treatment, but the thing it was gating is the pipeline's own payload,
    not prose -- and gating it made "graph looks wired, nothing flows" a silent,
    legal outcome. In a factorial batch that is a degenerate cell that still
    looks clean in the results table, which is worse than any confound it
    avoided. ``upstream_ids is None`` now means "derive it from the graph"
    rather than "emit nothing".

    Direct predecessors only (:func:`_upstream_ids` follows main edges). An
    ancestor further back never arrives on its own; reaching one is what an
    explicit ``{{node:X}}`` is for, and staying explicit is the point of it.

    **Structure, no prose.** A ``[Sender]`` label and a fence, and nothing else
    -- no heading, and no sentence telling the agent what the block is or how to
    treat it (see the note above this function for why that sentence was removed
    rather than reworded). Names come from the canvas
    label, since a model reads ``[Feature Engineer]`` as an author and
    ``[dndnode_3]`` as noise, and the label is what the user sees on the canvas
    and in the transcript, so one upstream step is called one thing everywhere.
    Unlabelled nodes fall back to ``_node_display_name``'s type placeholder, and
    the node id is appended only when two senders resolve to the same name --
    "which of the two" is the one question the id actually answers.

    The fence stays because Motoro wraps the whole assembled prompt in a single
    ``<<<USER_DATA>>>`` (``engine/reason.py``, ``plan.py``, ``act.py``) at a
    granularity that cannot separate this agent's instructions from its
    predecessor's output. The inner fence draws that line, and ``fence_upstream``
    neutralizes the delimiter inside the payload so an agent cannot write outside
    its own block.

    *exclude_ids* are senders the prompt already referenced by hand. Their block
    is dropped rather than repeated: the experimenter placed that output
    somewhere deliberate, and appending a second copy would be the platform
    overruling the placement. Per-sender, not all-or-nothing -- referencing one
    predecessor of a fan-in must not silently drop the other. Because the block
    built here is byte-identical to what :func:`_render_reference` builds, the
    two can be swapped without the prompt changing shape.

    This block is **not** frozen: the golden in ``tests/test_spinal_compat.py``
    is a change-detector that puts the diff in front of a reviewer, not a
    promise the text will not move.

    label), plus (flat, unstructured -- a deliberate V1 simplification) each
    already-completed upstream node's output_text as context, plus a Dataset
    cue when this node has a Dataset connector wired, plus a Script cue when
    one is wired. `prompt` is the one field meant to change per run (the
    per-invocation user message); `goal` is a persistent objective, only used
    here as prompt's own fallback when the user hasn't set one. Real structured
    handoff via output_contract.payload is a fast-follow, the same way the
    source notebook's own stage-report-block pattern could graduate to using
    it.

    Both the Dataset and the Script block used to be dictation: the exact
    ``open_workspace(experiment_id=..., cell_label=..., name=...)`` call, and
    the script's entire source pasted in for the model to copy back out into a
    tool argument. Neither is now. Both are References, and a Reference is
    bound into ambient request ``_meta``, not narrated (see the three routes at
    the top of this module, and Motoro's ``engine/sense.py``) -- ``_meta`` is
    out of the model's reach, so there is nothing to mistype. What stays here
    is only what ``_meta`` genuinely cannot supply: the *fact* that a dataset
    or a script is waiting, and the dataset name to disambiguate with when
    more than one is wired.

    *script_bound* says the wired scripts reached ``_meta`` as paths
    (``_ambient_meta_for``). Production callers provide either the experiment
    workspace or an isolated standalone-run directory, so source stays out of
    the prompt in both cases. The false branch is a defensive diagnostic for a
    materialization failure.

    *seeded_datasets* are the ``(dataset name, workspace slot)`` pairs ASAREE
    already opened on the agent's behalf (``_resolve_node_dataset``). When
    anything was seeded, the Dataset block stops asking for a tool call at all
    and just says the data is there -- opening a workspace was never a decision
    worth spending an agent turn on, and a step the agent can't skip is a step
    it can't get wrong. With several, the slot keys are named, because which
    dataset a call is about is the one part of that no ambient value can decide.

    *unsplit_dataset* is the same resolver's other outcome: a registration with
    no train/test split, bound as a plain file. Mutually exclusive with
    *seeded_datasets* -- a dataset has a split or it doesn't.

    *upstream_ids* overrides which senders the block draws from. Defaults to
    this node's main-edge predecessors, which is right for a pipeline; a
    caller that already knows who spoke to this agent (the messenger, whose
    dispatch does not have to be a direct edge) passes it explicitly rather
    than hoping the topology agrees.

    *unresolved_out*, when given, collects the node ids whose referenced output
    was empty. An out-parameter rather than a second return value because five
    of the six call sites do not care and one of them is an inline argument
    expression -- and because the string this returns is the whole point of
    calling it. Empty is the normal case.

    The prompt's own ``{{...}}`` references are resolved
    (:mod:`asaree.services.prompt_references`), the direct predecessors it did
    *not* place by hand are appended as an upstream block, and the shape the
    node's Output Parser declares is appended last."""

    **Never put per-run state in ``fields``.** Every entry here must come from
    the node's canvas config or its wired connectors -- i.e. from the protocol
    itself, which is what this row is a projection of. Run-scoped configuration
    belongs on the run: ``create_run`` already takes ``model_config_overrides``
    and ``config_snapshot``. The rule needs stating because this write path
    makes the mistake cheap to make and expensive to notice: ``update_agent``
    reads ``None`` as "leave unchanged", so a field written once during one run
    is never cleared by any later run and quietly contaminates every future one
    (see ``scripts/repair_contaminated_agents.py``, which cleans up an earlier
    design that injected a conversation contract this way).
